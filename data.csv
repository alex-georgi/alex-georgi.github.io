3,1982-1988,Atari,5200/7800,4.77,"While Atari's 5200 and 7800 systems improved on the performance of the 2600, its size, pricepoint, and controller caused it to struggle in a increasingly competitive market."

7,2005-2012,Nintendo,Wii,101.63,"Generation 7 Winner:<br>Although its hardware was significantly weaker than the competition, the Wii would find immense success in the casual & family gaming market. This marked the start of Nintendo's Blue Ocean approach, as they carved a market niche by offering unique and novel gaming experiences, such as motion controls in Wii Sports."
8,2012-2017,Nintendo,Wii U,13.56,"Falling far from the heights of the original, the failure of Nintendo's successor to the ubiquitous Wii is often blamed on a faulty marketing campaign, which led many consumers to believe the Wii U was an optional add-on to the Wii, rather than a new console. "

9,2017-Present,Sony,PlayStation 5,77.26,"Receiving widespread acclaim, the Playstation 5 was almost universally loved - if you could find one. The largest factor limiting Sony's sales, beyond the return to high pricing, was simply the lack of purchasing avaialbility for years after its release."
